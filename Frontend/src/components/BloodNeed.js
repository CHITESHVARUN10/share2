          Just as humans require blood transfusions for medical conditions or
          emergency situations, so do our beloved pets. Unfortunately, there is
          a shortage of available blood for pets, while the need for life-saving
          blood transfusions grows. We rely on the invaluable contributions of
          dog and cat donors to help save and improve the quality of petsâ€™
          lives, expand blood donor programs, and strengthen the human-animal
          bond. Every blood donor is considered a hero and their contribution
          can give the gift of life to animals in need.
